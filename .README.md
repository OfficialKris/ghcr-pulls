# Badges

## for GitHub Packages

A [JSON Endpoint](#endpoint) backed by a [SQLite Database](#database) to supplement the API.

---

With the help of GitHub Actions, this makes the following badges possible. To make a badge, you can modify one of the badges below or generate one with something like [shields.io/json](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) and [these parameters](#url). If we don't yet follow a package, you can either:

* open an issue or
* add it on a new line in `pkg.txt` on your own fork [here](https://github.com/ipitio/ghcr-pulls/edit/master/pkg.txt) and make a pull request.

```

For example, to get the current `latest` tag(s):

```markdown
version[?(@.tags.indexOf("latest") != -1)]
.tags[?(@ != "latest")]
```

Or to get the number of downloads in the last month for a version by name:

```markdown
version[?(@.name=="<VERSION>")].downloads_month
```

### TODO

Feel free to help with any of these:

* [ ] Make a GitHub Pages badge/JSONPath maker
* [ ] Get sizes for package types other than `container`
* [ ] Any other improvements or ideas you have -- see this [discussion](https://github.com/ipitio/ghcr-pulls/discussions/9)
