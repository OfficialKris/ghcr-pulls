# GitHub Packages Stats

## JSON Endpoint and Dataset

GitHub Packages doesn't provide an API endpoint for the download count, so it's scanned twice daily for every package in `pkg.txt`. The data is stored in `index.db`, a SQLite database that is then used to populate [`index.json`](./index.json) with the latest stats. See [JSON Endpoint](#json-endpoint) and [Database Schema](#database-schema) below for more information, including how to make badges for packages and versions.

Why all this? To make the following badges possible, of course. If we don't yet follow a package, you can either:

* open an issue or
* add it on a new line in `pkg.txt` on your own fork [here](https://github.com/ipitio/ghcr-pulls/edit/master/pkg.txt) and make a pull request.

### JSON Endpoint

Refreshed every other hour, for packages that haven't been scanned in the last 12 hours, the endpoint is always up-to-date. To make a badge, you can modify one of the badges above or generate one with something like [shields.io/json](https://shields.io/badges/dynamic-json-badge) and these parameters:

#### URL

```markdown
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipitio/ghcr-pulls/master/index.json
```

#### JSONPath

Just fill in the blanks to get what you want!

### TODO

Feel free to help with any of these:

* [ ] Make a GitHub Pages badge/JSONPath maker
* [ ] Get sizes for package types other than `container`
* [ ] Any other improvements or ideas you have
